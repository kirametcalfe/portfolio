							<i><h4>The Golden Statue</h4></i>
							<p>Originally published in the 2020 Elizabeth River Press Annual</p>
							<p>“Nothing can take the sting off the world's economic problems like watching millionaires present each other golden statues.” - Billy Crystal</p>
 							<p>“The mean reds are horrible. Suddenly you’re afraid, and you don’t know what you’re afraid of. Do you ever get that feeling?” - Truman Capote, Breakfast at Tiffany’s</p>
								
							<p>*</p>
								<p>It’s Hollywood’s biggest night. Polly and her friends clamour around the flat screen, each with a Vanity Fair prediction printable in hand. Everyone is in conversation, ignoring the talk of Marchesa and Saint Laurent. 
								Randy opens the heavy door to Polly’s apartment and stumbles inside, a joint hanging from his lips. 
								“Here comes the fun!” says Randy. 
								Polly rolls her eyes.</p> 
								
								<p>Janet, Paul and Mark follow Randy inside, all of whom likewise don’t appreciate the subtle art of red-carpet coverage. Randy plops down onto the blue velvet loveseat next to Polly. 
								She promptly turns on her hostess voice, “Shh! It’s starting!”</p> 
								
								<p>Janet follows the opening monologue with a yawn while Paul and Mark return to discussing the state of American Politics.
								“Mark, come on. It’s the era of Trump. I don’t think we even know what that actually means yet! I do know we’re fucked though,” says Janet, flicking her cigarette ashes into her empty glass. 
								Polly pushes the ashtray on the coffee table towards her and Janet gives her a thin-lipped smile. In the background the TV blares commercials for an actor-endorsed gin company and luxury vacation destinations. Polly stares at the flashing images for what feels like an eternity but gets pulled back to reality by Mark and Paul’s escalating tones.
								“--Fuck Trump. Let’s get drunk,” says Polly. 
								“That almost rhymed!” says Mark. Randy pokes his head out of the kitchen.
								“Don’t worry, already on it!”
								“Make mine a double,” says Janet, causing a chorus of the same from the room.</p>
								
								<p>Polly sits back pleased and unwound with the glass of Merlot Randy brought her.
								To her left Jodie and Ronnie are discussing the repercussions of James Comey’s firing last May. She can see Mark wanting to get in on their conversation. Janet and Paul are now well into a tête-à-tête regarding the pros and cons of acting in digital projects versus traditional media. 
								“Yes, ad revenue sucks, but if the channel’s tied to an MCN you got some stability there,” says Paul. 
								Polly and Randy give each other a look as Janet pulls Paul off the couch mid-sentence and takes him across the living room to the open balcony door. Janet’s talked numerous times about how she can only enjoy her alcoholic beverages with a breeze in her hair. With everyone in their resettled positions, Polly and Randy continue debating the gender wage gap. 
								“People need to tell each other how much they make. Especially in the same industry,” says Polly.
								“Umm, no! I don’t want anyone knowing what I make. It’s just gonna cause problems.” Polly cocks her head back with a sly smile.
								“What if it got you a raise?” asks Polly. Randy shifts his eyes back and forth in thought and purses his lips.
								“Touché.” 
								Polly takes the last swig of her Merlot and hands her glass to him. Randy heads to the kitchen but turns around with the wine bottle still sitting on the counter a few feet ahead of him.
								“But—” Polly interrupts him, chuckling, “Oh for fuck’s sake, at least get my wine first.”</p>
								
								<p>Across the room Polly can hear one of her oldest friends, Demetri, bring up the Best Picture snafu from the year before, answered by a unison roar of laughter. Randy brings the bottle of Merlot to the coffee table. As more of the same commercials flash across the screen he tops up Polly’s glass mid-conversation, gesticulating wildly, lips flapping with statistics. With her wine glass volume adequately maintained, Polly checks out of their conversation. She starts wondering how much the ad fees tonight are compared to the Super Bowl. Polly grew up watching the Super Bowl and only started watching the Oscars when she got serious about acting.</p> 
								
								<p>Everything is only as important as the money put behind it, she thinks. She waves her thoughts away, just as she waves away the smoke from Randy’s joint.
								“Anyway, you still shopping around that script?” asks Randy.
								“Actually…”
								“No way! What the fuck, you’ve been sitting on that the whole night?” Only ninety minutes or so have passed since Randy arrived and the night would go on for the better part of the next day. “Guys, guys! Polly’s script got bought!” A chorus of cheers fell over a giggling Polly. Demitri was now beside her with a hug and a kiss on the cheek. He also saved her wine glass from the advances of a now rather sloppily drunk Janet.
								“The wind is the trick,” whispered Randy to Polly and she let out a cackling laugh that was quickly buried in the cacophony of her guests.</p>
								
								<p>The room goes still suddenly, everyone is talking in hushed tones and even the TV seems quieter than it was a second ago. Polly is certain there’s still another half-hour until the last major categories. The announcement of Best Supporting Actress confirms her instinct. 
								A loud boom sounds from the TV.
								“What the fuck!?” says Janet, staring at the screen.
								Everyone turns their attention to the show for the first time since it began. The picture is hazy now and screams echo from the speakers. Red and gold opulence is replaced with shrieks and toppled cameras. Within seconds the SMPTE colour bars pop up and the screams are replaced with a high-pitched whine.</p>
								
								<p>Everyone’s phones chime with the same chirp of Twitter notifications, creating a melody backdropped by stunned silence mixed with singular words of disbelief. 
								"Someone on Twitter is saying it was a bomb,” says Mark. 
								Polly’s eyes lock with Randy’s, both turn their gazes over to the mantel. In the middle sits a golden statue from the year before. An itch develops in her right foot’s cast.
								Polly turns back to him, “Rand, I was supposed to go.”</p>
